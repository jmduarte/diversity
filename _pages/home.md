## Department EDI Statement

 > The UC San Diego Physics Department believes that the progress of science and the Universityâ€™s educational goals are enriched when faculty, staff, and students from diverse personal, social, and academic backgrounds are able to fully participate in the life of the Department. To this end, and consistent with the campus Principles of Community, our Department is committed to treating all current and prospective students, faculty, and staff equitably, with kindness, dignity, and respect, and to creating and maintaining an environment which is welcoming and supportive of all.
